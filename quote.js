Socrates: Glaucon, imagine if you will a cave where people have been imprisoned since childhood. They’re chained by their legs and necks so that they’re fixed in place, forced to look only at the wall directly in front of them.

Glaucon: Only at the wall? They can’t turn to see each other or even themselves?

Socrates: Exactly. They are completely fixed, with no view of anything but the wall before them. Now, behind these prisoners, there is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners, there’s a raised walkway. Along this walkway, people carry objects or puppets—shapes of men, animals, and other things.

Glaucon: So, these figures pass behind the prisoners, and they can’t see them directly?

Socrates: Precisely. The people who carry these objects walk behind a low wall so that only the objects themselves cast shadows on the cave wall in front of the prisoners. It’s like a puppet show where the puppeteers are hidden from the audience.

Glaucon: So, the prisoners would only see the shadows of these objects?

Socrates: Yes, only the shadows. And when the people carrying the objects speak, the sounds echo off the walls of the cave. The prisoners, having never seen or heard anything else, would believe that these shadows and echoes are the only reality.

Glaucon: They’d think the shadows and sounds on the wall were all there is. They wouldn’t even imagine that there’s anything more.

Socrates: Exactly. For them, the shadows are the only reality they’ve ever known. They have no reason to think there could be anything beyond the shadows on the wall.

Glaucon: But what if they were freed? What would happen if one of the prisoners managed to escape?

Socrates: Good question. Imagine, then, that one prisoner is suddenly released. For the first time, he turns around and sees the fire behind him. The light would hurt his eyes, and he’d struggle to see the objects that were casting the shadows.

Glaucon: I can imagine. He’d likely be confused. After all, he’s never seen anything other than the shadows.

Socrates: Precisely. If someone told him that the things he now sees are more real than the shadows on the wall, he wouldn’t believe it at first. The light would be too painful, and the strange new sights would overwhelm him. He would probably want to turn back to what’s familiar—to the shadows.

Glaucon: So he would retreat to what he knows?

Socrates: Yes. But now, suppose someone dragged him by force, up the rough, steep path, out of the cave and into the light of the sun.

Glaucon: He’d be furious, wouldn’t he? The light would be even more blinding outside!

Socrates: Absolutely. The sunlight would be unbearable at first, and he’d likely be angry and confused. But gradually, his eyes would adjust to the brightness. First, he’d only be able to see shadows, then reflections in water. Slowly, he’d begin to see people and objects around him.

Glaucon: And eventually, he’d be able to look at the world as it truly is?

Socrates: Yes, indeed. Eventually, he would be able to see the stars and the moon at night, and finally, he’d look upon the sun itself. Only then could he understand that the sun is the source of light and life—the ultimate reality.

Glaucon: He would realize how limited his understanding was in the cave. The shadows would seem like mere illusions.

Socrates: Exactly, Glaucon. He would bless himself for having escaped the cave and feel pity for the prisoners still trapped inside. He would want to return to them and try to show them the path to the light.

Glaucon: But wouldn’t he be blinded when he re-entered the cave?

Socrates: Yes, his eyes, accustomed to sunlight, would struggle in the darkness. The prisoners still inside would see him stumbling and think that his journey had harmed him. They’d believe that leaving the cave was dangerous and would reject anyone who tried to bring them out.

Glaucon: So, they would rather stay with the shadows, thinking it safer than facing the unknown.

Socrates: Precisely. And if they could, they would even kill anyone who tried to free them from their chains. To them, the shadows are reality, and the pain of breaking free would seem too great a risk. This, my dear Glaucon, is the state of the human soul when it is shackled by ignorance.
